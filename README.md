# Known Issues
The support for hypen words must be added externally and process separately, it is not added.

The prefixes can make issues by the moment.

In spite of the algorithm supports it, it is not implemented the support for "tl" or other configurations that are not from Spain. It is only works with "Castillian" (spanish from Spain with the known mistakes).
